# SentimentAnalysisOnAmazonReviews

## Overview

This project is focused on performing sentiment analysis on Amazon product reviews. Sentiment analysis is the process of determining the emotional tone or sentiment expressed in a piece of text. In this case, we aim to classify Amazon product reviews as positive, negative, or neutral based on the sentiments expressed in the text.

## Project Description

The primary goal of the "Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Reviews" project is to develop a model that can effectively classify Amazon product reviews into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. This involves testing various machine learning techniques, including SNN (Simple Neural Networks), 1D CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks), LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), and Bi-Directional LSTM.

To achieve this, the project includes a thorough evaluation process that checks for underfitting (when a model is too simple to capture patterns) and overfitting (when a model is too specialized and doesn't generalize well) for each of these techniques. Visual representations of underfitting and overfitting curves are utilized to make an informed selection of the most suitable machine learning technique.

By doing so, this project aims to provide a reliable and accurate sentiment analysis tool for Amazon reviews, with a focus on model performance and robustness, while considering multiple advanced techniques for the task.

## Data Collection

The data source is from Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kritanjalijain/amazon-reviews

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in any NLP project. In this project, we perform tasks such as text cleaning, tokenization, removing stop words, and feature extraction (e.g., TF-IDF or word embeddings) to prepare the data for model training.

## Model Building

We build a machine learning or deep learning model to classify the sentiment of the reviews. Techniques used include SNN, CNN (1D), LSTM, LSTM (Bi-Directional).

## Model Evaluation

To assess the performance of our sentiment analysis model, we use evaluation metrics as accuracy. We also perform cross-validation to ensure the model's generalizability.

## Deployment

For real-world applications, you can deploy the trained model as a web service or integrate it into your application. Popular deployment options include Flask or FastAPI for creating RESTful APIs.
